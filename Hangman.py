#In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it.
# In Part 2, we wrote the logic for guessing the letter and displaying
# that information to the user. In this exercise,
# we have to put it all together and add logic for handling guesses.

#Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
# Keep track of the letters the user guessed.
# If the user guesses a letter they already guessed,
# donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.

#When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
